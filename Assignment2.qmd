# Part A

## Report

### Executive summary:

The article is about impact of Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Quarantine systems remain valuable but not enough for authorities to control the outbreak of the epidemics. Mass vaccinations, highly effective vaccines and infection control inside quarantine facilities are necessary. Without them, the speed and possibility of the community outbreaks will rise sharply as the transmissibility increases.

### Introduction to the problem :

More transmissible variants(notable Delta) of SARS-CoV-2 appeared and posed great challenges to initial quarantine system. The article evaluates how well "low-tolerance" border-quarantine systems can prevent the community outbreaks. Then it indicates that quarantine system is valuable but not enough.

### Key results:

1.As @fig-heatmap indicates, We find that under the assumption that the R0 =3 and VE=0， when R0 increases, to maintain the risk steady, VE should be greater than 60% if R0=6, VE should be greater than 70% if R0=8. However, when R0 =10, the VE need to be greater than 70% as well.

2.As @fig-t50 indicates, we find that as Vaccine coverage and VE increase, t-50 has increased.It takes more time to outbreak. (t-50 means time to reach a 50% probability of ≥5 transmission clusters)

### Brief methods:

-   Two stage modelling framework

    An individual -based model of hotel-quarantine facility(100 travellers; \~20 vaccinated staff)with 14-day minimum stay, RT-PCR testing on day 3 and day 12, cohorting travellers in groups of four, and rapid isolation of positives and close contacts.

    A branching-process model that ingests "branch events" from stage 1 to estimate the probability of community outbreaks

-   Key parameters & scenarios

    Variant transmissibility parameterized by R0 ranging from \~3(pre-Delta) up to 10(Delta-like upper bound)

    Vaccine effectiveness(VE) considered against infection and (in sensitivity analyses) against onward transmission; community coverage varied from 10% top 100%.

    Primary performance metric: cumulative "infectious pressure" of quarantine breaches relative to a pre-vaccine baseline.
